This is my personal version of Vax-man game using python, which is the first task of EA Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program from Forage.com.

Pac-Man is one of the world's oldest computer games. In this task, we are going to pay tribute to Pac-Man. 

We are building a new game called Vax-Man. The rules are similar to Pac-Man with several notable exceptions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it). </li>
  <li>Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.</li>
  <li>Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).</li>
  <li>The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.</li>
</ul>

<b>Dependencies</b>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.x</li>
  <li>Pygame > 1.4</li>
</ul>
To <b>play</b>, run pacman_game.py and use directional arrows to move.
